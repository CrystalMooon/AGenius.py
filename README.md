# Genius.py
`Genius.py` is a [LyricsGenius](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius) fork, making it easy to use, and async ready.

## Key Features
* Pythonic `async`/`await`.
* Removed every possible instance of the `Public API` to make it **safer**.

## Setup
You'll need a free [Genius](https://genius.com) account to get access to 
the [Genius API](https://genius.com/api-clients). This provides an `access_token` that is required.
